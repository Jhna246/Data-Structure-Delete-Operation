Implement the delete operation for a binary search tree for the input
as shown in Assignment #02. For example, if you have implemented the
algorithm in Java, the output will look like this. You don't have to
write the updated result to file.

```sh
+---------------------------------------------------------------+
|  $ java Test                                                  |
|  Enter the word to delete: abcde                              |
|  The word "abcde" doesn't exist                               |
|                                                               |
|  Enter the word to delete: after                              |
|  The word "after" is deleted                                  |
|                                                               |
|  Enter the word to delete: after                              |
|  The word "after" doesn't exist                               |
|                                                               |
|  Enter the word to delete: _                                  |
